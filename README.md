Three types of recommender system are used:
 # Demographic Filtering:

 They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.
 # Content Based Filtering:

 They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.
 # Collaborative Filtering:
 ![collaborative](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55571522/65369485-34629c80-dc6b-11e9-8333-d321aead184a.png)

 This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.
